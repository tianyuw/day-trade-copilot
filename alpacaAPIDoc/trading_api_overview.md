Fractional Trading
Fractional shares are fractions of a whole share, meaning that you don’t need to buy a whole share to own a portion of a company. You can now buy as little as $1 worth of shares for over 2,000 US equities. For more click here.

We only allow market orders for fractional trading at the moment.
