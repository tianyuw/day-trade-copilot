# Get Account Portfolio History

Returns timeseries data about equity and profit/loss (P/L) of the account in requested timespan.

# Usage for equity-traders

By default, for `timeframes` less than 1D,  the API returns the data points during market open times, to change this behavior the `intraday_reporting` query can be set to `extended_hours`, to include the premarket and after-hours trading prices.

# Usage for crypto-traders

The API can be used both for crypto and equities trading accounts. By default the API is aiming at the equities trading use-case, however, it can be configured to return data more suited for visualizing crypto portfolios.

For crypto, we recommend setting the following flags:

* `intraday_reporting=continuous`  so that 24/7 graphs are returned
* `pnl_reset=no_reset` so that the Profit And Loss calculation is continuous over the given period of time.

The `timeframe` can only be set to less than 1 day, when the requested `period` is less than  30 days.

# Profit and loss calculation

For profit and loss calculation we are using simple profit and loss to calculate the pnl percentage for a given time:

`pnl_pct = equity/base_value-1`

`base_value` and `base_value_asof` typically corresponds to the first available datapoint and timestamp unless the first data point reflects a zero (0) value. Portfolio value may be zero if the account is new or is not funded as of the beginning of the time period reflected in the chart. If `base_value_asof` is omitted from the response, there are no non-zero values and portfolio has no value for the duration of the requested chart.

# Notes

When `intraday_reporting=continuous`, equity calculations are based on the following prices:

* Between 4:00am and 10:00pm on trading days the valuation will be calculated based on the last trade (extended hours and normal hours respectively).
* After 10:00pm, until the next session open the equities will be valued at their official closing price on the primary exchange.

When `timeframe=1D`, `intraday_reporting` has no effect and the response will only contain entries for days when the market is open.

All the cash values returned to two digits. All percentage values are rounded to 4 digits.
