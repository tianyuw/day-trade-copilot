By default, the order is only valid during Regular Trading Hours (9:30am - 4:00pm ET). If unfilled after the closing auction, it is automatically canceled. If submitted after the close, it is queued and submitted the following trading day. However, if marked as eligible for extended hours, the order can also execute during supported extended hours.\n\n- gtc:\n  The order is good until canceled. Non-marketable GTC limit orders are subject to price adjustments to offset corporate actions affecting the issue. We do not currently support Do Not Reduce(DNR) orders to opt out of such price adjustments.\n\n- opg:\n  Use this TIF with a market/limit order type to submit “market on open” (MOO) and “limit on open” (LOO) orders. This order is eligible to execute only in the market opening auction. Any unfilled orders after the open will be cancelled. OPG orders submitted after 9:28am but before 7:00pm ET will be rejected. OPG orders submitted after 7:00pm will be queued and routed to the following day’s opening auction. On open/on close orders are routed to the primary exchange. Such orders do not necessarily execute exactly at 9:30am / 4:00pm ET but execute per the exchange’s auction rules.\n\n- cls:\n  Use this TIF with a market/limit order type to submit “market on close” (MOC) and “limit on close” (LOC) orders. This order is eligible to execute only in the market closing auction. Any unfilled orders after the close will be cancelled. CLS orders submitted after 3:50pm but before 7:00pm ET will be rejected. CLS orders submitted after 7:00pm will be queued and routed to the following day’s closing auction. Only available with API v2.\n\n- ioc:\n  An Immediate Or Cancel (IOC) order requires all or part of the order to be executed immediately. Any unfilled portion of the order is canceled. Only available with API v2. Most market makers who receive IOC orders will attempt to fill the order on a principal basis only, and cancel any unfilled balance. On occasion, this can result in the entire order being cancelled if the market maker does not have any existing inventory of the security in question.\n\n- fok:\n  A Fill or Kill (FOK) order is only executed if the entire order quantity can be filled, otherwise the order is canceled. Only available with API v2.",

This can be either due to a cancel request by the user, or the order has been canceled by the exchanges due to its time-in-force.\n\n- expired\n  The order has expired, and no further updates will occur for the order.\n\n- replaced\n  The order was replaced by another order, or was updated due to a market event such as corporate action.\n\n- pending_cancel\n  The order is waiting to be canceled.\n\n- pending_replace\n  The order is waiting to be replaced by another order. The order will reject cancel request while in this state.\n\nLess common states are described below. Note that these states only occur on very rare occasions, and most users will likely never see their orders reach these states:\n\n- accepted\n  The order has been received by Alpaca, but hasn’t yet been routed to the execution venue. This could be seen often out side of trading session hours.\n\n- pending_new\n  The order has been received by Alpaca, and routed to the exchanges, but has not yet been accepted for execution. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- accepted_for_bidding\n  The order has been received by exchanges, and is evaluated for pricing. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- stopped\n  The order has been stopped, and a trade is guaranteed for the order, usually at a stated price or better, but has not yet occurred. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- rejected\n  The order has been rejected, and no further updates will occur for the order. This state occurs on rare occasions and may occur based on various conditions decided by the exchanges.\n\n- suspended\n  The order has been suspended, and is not eligible for trading. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- calculated\n  The order has been completed for the day (either filled or done for day), but remaining settlement calculations are still pending. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n\nAn order may be canceled through the API up until the point it reaches a state of either filled, canceled, or expired.",

Here is a breakdown of the supported TIFs for each specific security type:\n- Equity trading: day, gtc, opg, cls, ioc, fok.\n- Options trading: day.\n- Crypto trading: gtc, ioc.\n\nBelow are the descriptions of each TIF:\n- day:\n  A day order is eligible for execution only on the day it is live. By default, the order is only valid during Regular Trading Hours (9:30am - 4:00pm ET). If unfilled after the closing auction, it is automatically canceled. If submitted after the close, it is queued and submitted the following trading day. However, if marked as eligible for extended hours, the order can also execute during supported extended hours.\n\n- gtc:\n  The order is good until canceled. Non-marketable GTC limit orders are subject to price adjustments to offset corporate actions affecting the issue. We do not currently support Do Not Reduce(DNR) orders to opt out of such price adjustments.\n\n- opg:\n  Use this TIF with a market/limit order type to submit “market on open” (MOO) and “limit on open” (LOO) orders. This order is eligible to execute only in the market opening auction. Any unfilled orders after the open will be cancelled. OPG orders submitted after 9:28am but before 7:00pm ET will be rejected. OPG orders submitted after 7:00pm will be queued and routed to the following day’s opening auction. On open/on close orders are routed to the primary exchange. Such orders do not necessarily execute exactly at 9:30am / 4:00pm ET but execute per the exchange’s auction rules.\n\n- cls:\n  Use this TIF with a market/limit order type to submit “market on close” (MOC) and “limit on close” (LOC) orders. This order is eligible to execute only in the market closing auction. Any unfilled orders after the close will be cancelled. CLS orders submitted after 3:50pm but before 7:00pm ET will be rejected. CLS orders submitted after 7:00pm will be queued and routed to the following day’s closing auction. Only available with API v2.\n\n- ioc:\n  An Immediate Or Cancel (IOC) order requires all or part of the order to be executed immediately. Any unfilled portion of the order is canceled. Only available with API v2. Most market makers who receive IOC orders will attempt to fill the order on a principal basis only, and cancel any unfilled balance. On occasion, this can result in the entire order being cancelled if the market maker does not have any existing inventory of the security in question.\n\n- fok:\n  A Fill or Kill (FOK) order is only executed if the entire order quantity can be filled, otherwise the order is canceled. Only available with API v2.",

This can be either due to a cancel request by the user, or the order has been canceled by the exchanges due to its time-in-force.\n\n- expired\n  The order has expired, and no further updates will occur for the order.\n\n- replaced\n  The order was replaced by another order, or was updated due to a market event such as corporate action.\n\n- pending_cancel\n  The order is waiting to be canceled.\n\n- pending_replace\n  The order is waiting to be replaced by another order. The order will reject cancel request while in this state.\n\nLess common states are described below. Note that these states only occur on very rare occasions, and most users will likely never see their orders reach these states:\n\n- accepted\n  The order has been received by Alpaca, but hasn’t yet been routed to the execution venue. This could be seen often out side of trading session hours.\n\n- pending_new\n  The order has been received by Alpaca, and routed to the exchanges, but has not yet been accepted for execution. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- accepted_for_bidding\n  The order has been received by exchanges, and is evaluated for pricing. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- stopped\n  The order has been stopped, and a trade is guaranteed for the order, usually at a stated price or better, but has not yet occurred. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- rejected\n  The order has been rejected, and no further updates will occur for the order. This state occurs on rare occasions and may occur based on various conditions decided by the exchanges.\n\n- suspended\n  The order has been suspended, and is not eligible for trading. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n- calculated\n  The order has been completed for the day (either filled or done for day), but remaining settlement calculations are still pending. This state only occurs on rare occasions.\n\n\nAn order may be canceled through the API up until the point it reaches a state of either filled, canceled, or expired.",
