# Download an Account Document

This endpoint downloads an account document based on the document ID. The document will be in PDF format.

The operation returns a pre-signed downloadable link as a redirect with HTTP status code 301 if one is found.

You can retrieve a JSON version of a monthly statement by passing in the header accept: application/json header.

These account documents are tax statements, trade confirmations, etc, generated by the Alpaca system. They are distinct from the owner documents you upload and later access via the account object's documents property.
