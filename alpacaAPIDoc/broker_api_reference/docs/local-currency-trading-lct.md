Local Currency Trading (LCT)
Local Currency Trading allows customers to trade US equities in over 15+ local currencies, with FX conversion done on-the-fly. Customers can place, monitor and sell their positions in their local currency.

API responses are all in your local currency, with all calculations handled by Alpaca.

Further below, we will examine the some common scenarios with LCT. The recurring theme you will notice is that many of Alpaca’s API commands are almost the same, it is just the response that have changed. In some cases, barring the introduction of a currency specification or a swap rate, the only indication of the trade being in Local Currency is the inclusion of a USD second order JSON.

For further questions about LCT, such as supported currencies or any other relevant details, see LCT FAQs.

Get Market Data
With LCT, we have introduced a currency parameter for stock market data. You can request pricing data for any equity and we will handle the necessary conversions to quote the asset in the requested local currency.

The example below shows how to get pricing data for AAPL in JPY. The pricing information is converted from USD to the relevant local currency on the fly with the latest FX rate at the point in time of query.
cURL

curl --request GET 'https://data.alpaca.markets/v2/stocks/AAPL/bars?start=2024-08-01T0:00:00Z&end=2024-08-19T11:00:00Z&timeframe=1Min&currency=JPY'JSON

Note currency key value is
JPY. Request the same endpoint without the
currency parameter to compare the pricing data against its
USD equivalent.

Create an LCT Account
For LCT, you can leverage the traditional Accounts API to create any of the following account types:

Fully Disclosed

Omnibus

Omnibus via the Alpaca Sub Ledger Solution

Below we provide an example of creating a account for a fully-disclosed setup with JPY as the local currency.

Fund LCT Account
Accounts can be funded for LCT by either:

Bank Wire

Just in Time Cash

Just In Time

The below example funds one of our JPY accounts created above, with JIT API
POST /v1/transfers/jit/transactions with the following body:

Estimate Stock Order
Customers using LCT for the first time may not be sure how much their local currency can buy of a US stock. To address this pain point we created the Order Estimation Endpoint. The customer can enter:

the security

the notional value

on the developer side you can input your swap rate to return the realistic value that your customer will receive.

We get in return indicative quantity, average price and USD value.
JSON

{
 "symbol": "AAPL",
 "side": "buy",
 "type": "market",
 "time_in_force": "day",
 "notional": "4000",
 "swap_fee_bps": 100
}
The above payload will get an estimation for a market order to purchase AAPL stock with a notional amount of 4000 JPY.

Submit Order
Alpaca currently supports LCT trading for market, limit, stop & stop limit orders with a time in force=Day, accommodating both fractional quantities and notional values. You can pass either a fractional amount (qty), or a notional value (notional) in your local currency in any POST/v2/orders request. Note that entering a value for either parameters, will automatically nullify the other. If both qty and notional are entered the request will be rejected with an error status 400.

Moreover, we support fractional shares trading not only during standard market hours, but extending into pre-market (4:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. ET) and post-market (4:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. ET) hours, offering global investors the ability to trade during the full extended hours session.

Submit a Stock Market Order
Once having estimated a given order, we can actually commit to and execute the order using the usual Orders API.

We note here a few key LCT specific order attributes:

swap_fee_bps - this is the correspondent spread. You as the correspondent can increase or decrease this as you require. Note: Alpaca will have a separate spread

Quantity-based orders will also be accepted

Submit a Stock Stop Limit Order
We note here a few key LCT specific order attributes:

stop_price field in the request payload is in USD currency while in the response payload it is in local currency.

limit_price field in the request payload is in USD currency while in the response payload it is in local currency.

swap_fee_bps - this is the correspondent spread. You as the correspondent can increase or decrease this as you require. Note: Alpaca will have a separate spread
