Alpaca MCP Server
Turn your words into action with Alpaca’s MCP Server

Alpaca’s MCP Server allows traders to research markets, analyze data, and place orders using natural language across AI chat applications, coding tools, and Command Line Interfaces.

Alpaca’s MCP Server GitHub URL: https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-mcp-server

For more information, visit Alpaca's MCP Server Homepage.

All data and instructions are current as of November 20, 2025.

MCP Server Overview
An MCP server is a component of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture developed by Anthropic. MCP is an open standard that provides a consistent way for AI applications, code editors, or Command Line Interface to interact with external tools, data sources, and services through a structured protocol.

As AI interfaces improve, connecting them to trading workflows often requires multiple APIs, custom integrations, and authentication steps. MCP architecture streamlines this by providing a standard method for accessing data and performing actions.

An MCP server itself acts as a bridge between the MCP client (AI interfaces) and the capabilities. It presents these capabilities in a predictable and secure format so an AI model can request market data, retrieve information, or carry out defined operations without additional SDKs or complex setup.

Alpaca’s MCP Server Overview
Alpaca’s MCP Server brings this same bridge-like concept to trading by exposing capabilities powered by Alpaca’s Trading API, including:

Market data, both historical and live

Order actions such as entry, change, and cancel

Portfolio details like positions, buying power, and unrealized P/L

Optional automation like alerts or risk checks

This helps users accelerate their research, streamline decision making, and support efficient trade execution, helping users capitalize on potential market opportunities more efficiently.
For more information about the available functions, please see the Available Endpoints section below.

Main Benefits
Reinforced Decisions, Transparent Execution
Alpaca’s MCP Server gives your AI model structured access to real time market data, news context, portfolio details, and order actions powered by Alpaca’s Trading API. Instead of acting on its own, the AI assistants help surface relevant insights, organize information, and prepare the actions you ask for.

One Interface for Many Markets
Alpaca’s MCP Server brings equities, ETFs, crypto, and multi-leg options into one workflow and interface. This allows an AI agent to research, analyze, and help execute trading ideas without switching between platforms or juggling APIs.

Code-Optional, Extensible by Design
Alpaca’s MCP Server lets traders begin with natural language prompts and move into vibe coding or full code whenever they want to optimize strategies.

Supported MCP Clients and Connection Types
Alpaca’s MCP Server can be configured on the following MCP clients. Each client has its own setup requirements. For more details, visit Alpaca’s MCP Server GitHub . The connection type indicates how you can set up Alpaca’s MCP Server.

Note: Remote hosting for Alpaca’s MCP Server is not yet available. Traders who wish to use it remotely will need to self host for now. We may consider additional options for remote MCP Server use over time, depending on feasibility and demand.

For instructions on self hosting Alpaca’s remote MCP Server, visit our learn article “How to Deploy Alpaca’s MCP Server Remotely on Claude Mobile App ”.

Important Considerations When Trading with Alpaca’s MCP Server
Using Alpaca’s MCP Server introduces a few important considerations:

Make sure your Alpaca API keys are linked to the correct account type such as live or paper.

Some AI tools (MCP clients) may require a paid subscription if you use the MCP Server frequently.

Review and confirm orders directly on your Alpaca dashboard. You can do this in real time to ensure accuracy before or after submitting trades.

Security Considerations for Remote MCP Server Deployment
Running an MCP server remotely introduces a few important security considerations. Many early stage examples such as FastMCP are designed for local testing and may not include authentication or encrypted communication by default.

When a server is publicly accessible, it is possible for external requests to reach it. If the server handles sensitive information such as Alpaca Trading API keys, this can create a risk of unauthorized access or unintended tool execution.

To reduce these risks, a secure deployment should include HTTPS or TLS for encrypted communication and a reliable token based authentication method. Taking these steps helps protect your credentials and ensures that only trusted clients can interact with your MCP server.
