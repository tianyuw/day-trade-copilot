Fixed Income
This guide provides a comprehensive reference for integrating U.S. Treasuries and U.S. Corporate Bonds into your platform.

Overview of Fixed Income Products
Alpaca offers Broker API partners access to a growing range of fixed income securities. These products provide a way for end-users to diversify their portfolios with debt instruments.

Product Categories
U.S. Treasuries: Sovereign debt securities issued by the U.S. government. We currently support Treasury Bills (T-Bills) and will be expanding to include Treasury Notes (T-Notes) and Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds).

U.S. Corporate Bonds: Debt securities issued by U.S. corporations. We support a variety of investment-grade, and high-yield bonds.

Key Features
API-Driven Trading: All trading and data retrieval is executed via the Broker API.

Best-Price Execution: Alpaca aggregates quotes from multiple liquidity providers to ensure competitive pricing during U.S. bond market hours.

Broad Access: Available to all Broker API partners and their end-users.

Full Denominations: Securities are traded in full denominations, typically in increments of $1,000 face value. Fractional trading is planned for a future release.

Trading and Orders
The core mechanics of placing and managing orders are consistent across all fixed income products.

Market Hours
Regular Hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET.

Pre-Market and After-Hours Queue: Orders submitted between 4.00 PM - 9:30 AM ET (next day) are queued and sent for execution at the market open. For weekends, orders submitted between 4.00 PM on Friday until 9.30 AM ET Monday will be queued and executed on Monday when the market opens.

Order Management
Placing Orders: All orders are submitted via the API. Currently, market and limit orders with a day time-in-force are supported.

Order Queuing: Orders placed outside of market hours are given an accepted status and are executed when the market reopens.

Cancellations:
During Market Hours: Cancellation requests are sent to the execution venue immediately.

Outside Market Hours: Orders with an accepted status are cancelled immediately. Orders already sent to a venue will become pending_cancel until the market reopens.

Order Size
Minimum Order Size: $1,000 face value.

Maximum Order Size: $1,000,000 face value.

Pricing, Markups, and Fees
Clean Price: Prices are quoted as a percentage of the bond's par value (face value). This is the "clean price" and does not include accrued interest. The final settlement amount will include any accrued interest for coupon-bearing bonds.

Markups: Markups from Alpaca and/or partners are included in the final execution price.

Regulatory Fees: Sales of U.S. Treasuries are reportable to the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) and incur a small regulatory fee.

U.S. Treasuries API Reference
U.S. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) are short-term government debt securities with maturities of one year or less. They are issued at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity, with no periodic coupon payments.

Fixed income securities can experience a greater risk of principal loss when interest rates rise. These investments are also subject to additional risks, including credit quality fluctuations, market volatility, liquidity constraints, prepayment or early redemption, corporate actions, tax implications, and other influencing factors.

All investments involve risk, and the past performance of a security, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. There is no guarantee that any investment strategy will achieve its objectives. Please note that diversification does not ensure a profit, or protect against loss. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities, or other financial products. Investors should consider their investment objectives and risks carefully before investing.

Securities brokerage services are provided by Alpaca Securities LLC ("Alpaca Securities"), member FINRA/SIPC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AlpacaDB, Inc. Technology and services are offered by AlpacaDB, Inc.

This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Alpaca Securities is not registered or licensed, as applicable.
